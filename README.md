todo_App_NodeJS README --

The following represents a To-do list made from Node.js, javascript and HTML.
Services used include:
* Express Server
* MongoDB Storage and persistence
* Bootstrap for styling

The app also makes use of best practices such as:
* gitignoring node_modules folder files and .env which has sensitive DB credentials.
* using nodemon to apply changes to server without restarting it
* persisting data on the list.
